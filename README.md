# Application of Machine Learning in Social Sciences at the OII

Welcome to the seminar talks on application of Machine Learning in Social Sciences taking place at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford. If you would like to present or have a suggestion please contact Dr Adam Mahdi (adam.mahdi@oii.ox.ac.uk). Currently the seminars are taking place in the hybrid format on Thursdays at 14.00.

__Speaker__:  	[Pawel Dlotko](https://dioscuri-tda.org/members/pawel.html) (Dioscuri Centre in Topological Data Analysis)\
__Title__:   Invitation to TDA\
__Abstract__: What is the shape of a collection of points or a sublevel set of a high dimensional function? Is there a way to explore it, understand it and apply it in a learning context? Topological Data Analysis, in particular mapper-type algorithms and persistent homology propose an answer to this question. In this talk we will briefly introduce those concepts and computational tools that can be used to compute them. We will also briefly mention some of their applications.
