__Title__:   Invitation to TDA

__Abstract__: What is the shape of a collection of points or a sublevel set of a high dimensional function? Is there a way to explore it, understand it and apply it in a learning context? Topological Data Analysis, in particular mapper-type algorithms and persistent homology propose an answer to this question. In this talk we will briefly introduce those concepts and computational tools that can be used to compute them. We will also briefly mention some of their applications.

__Title__:   Distributed algorithms for Euler Characteristic Curves (and Profiles)

__Abstract__: In many real life applications, the analysis of large, high dimensional distributions of data is often simplified by dividing them into bins along a continuous parameter. For example, covid patient data is often divided by age bands to study how age impacts covid outcomes. However, a poor choice of bins can give a misleading illustration of the data. We discuss how topological ideas, in particular those from Morse theory and topological data analysis, can guide how data on a manifold can be discretised into bins.

__Title__:    Active Learning - Motivation, Core-elements and SoQal

__Abstract__: Supervised learning has been the driving force behind many of today’s machine learning algorithms. The success of this approach, however, typically necessitates the presence of abundant labelled data, a resource which can be non-trivial to collect. In contrast, an increasing number of settings is characterized by both scarce labelled data and abundant unlabelled data. One way to leverage such data is via active learning, a paradigm that attempts to minimize the burden of providing annotations while designing generalizable algorithms. In this talk, I will first outline the motivation for active learning and discuss its four core elements (train, acquire, label, and augment). I will then introduce a recently-proposed framework known as SoQal which, in contrast to previous work, addresses two of active learning’s elements simultaneously (acquire and label). I will conclude the talk by reflecting on the utility of active learning and providing some guiding principles.

__Title__:    Using Transformers-Based Active Learning for Efficient and Effective Detection of Harmful Language

__Abstract__: Automated abusive language detection has predominately been approached using passive, fully supervised learning over a large, annotated dataset to maximize accuracy or F1-score. This approach focuses on user welfare, but ignores annotator welfare where viewing harmful content can be psychologically damaging. In this talk, I will present some of my recent research on active learning with abusive language detection, where we ask the question: is more data always better?  To answer this question, we use a series of simulated experiments over two datasets at varying percentages of abuse. We demonstrate that transformers-based active learning is a promising alternative approach, which maintains high efficacy but substantially raises efficiency by requiring a fraction of examples to reach equivalent performance. More data is not always better and sometimes it is worse. These findings demonstrates that a re-think is needed as to whether we require so many annotated examples of abusive language and thus whether the current paradigm puts annotators at undue harm.
