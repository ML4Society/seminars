# Application of Machine Learning in Social Sciences at the OII

Welcome to the seminar talks on application of Machine Learning in Social Sciences taking place at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford. If you would like to present or have a suggestion please contact Dr Adam Mahdi (adam.mahdi@oii.ox.ac.uk). Currently the seminars are taking place in the hybrid format on Thursdays at 14.00.

__Title__:   Invitation to TDA\
__Abstract__: What is the shape of a collection of points or a sublevel set of a high dimensional function? Is there a way to explore it, understand it and apply it in a learning context? Topological Data Analysis, in particular mapper-type algorithms and persistent homology propose an answer to this question. In this talk we will briefly introduce those concepts and computational tools that can be used to compute them. We will also briefly mention some of their applications.

__Speaker__:  	[Davide Gurnari](https://dioscuri-tda.org/members/davide.html) (Dioscuri Centre in Topological Data Analysis)\
__Title__:   Distributed algorithms for Euler Characteristic Curves (and Profiles)\
__Abstract__: Persistent homology is a technique from topological data analysis that has been shown to be powerful in a variety of applications. However new ideas and algorithms are needed in order to efficiently tackle big data problems.
In this talk I will present how topological features can be extracted using one of the most famous invariants, the Euler characteristic. The Euler characteristic of a simplicial complex is the alternate sum of its Betti number, or equivalently the alternating sum of the number of its simplices of following dimensions. For a filtered complex the Euler Characteristic Curve is a function that assigns an Euler number to each filtration level.
By following a distributed approach, the contributions to the ECC can be computed locally without having to explicitly build up the whole complex. This allows us to significatively reduce both time and memory requirements, giving us the opportunity to tackle much larger datasets compared to persistent homology. Such algorithms can be naturally extended to work in the multiparameter persistence setting, giving rise to the notion of Euler Characteristic Profiles.
